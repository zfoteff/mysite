    "I am interested in pursing careers as a backend software developer, or in the computer/network security field.\n\n\tMy Journey with computer science began when I was a freshman " +
    "in highschool. I discovered a Python IDE for iPad called Pythonista during Christmas vacation and experimented with every module I could -- even though I knew nothing about computer " +
    "syntax, or what a programming language even was at the time. Nevertheless, by the end of the break I was enamoured with the subject of computer science and was certain that I had " +
    "found something that I wanted to do for the rest of my life. Folowing that discovery, I took every computer science class that my highchool offered and continued to expand my knowledge at Gonzaga.";

const skills_string = "\tMy learning isn't just limited to the classroom. I spend much of my free time researching and " +
    "designing projects for myself in order to challenge myself and gain practical knowledge of the many different " +
    "aspects of computer science. You can find a selection of these projects displayed in the Personal Projects " +
    "tab of this website. In addition to various personal projects, I have devoted lots of time to learning " +
    "various other skills need in computer science and software development. I have a good understanding of Git " +
    "and its various tools for managing workflow, as well as developing a good understanding of the Linux" +
    "operating system.Additionally, I have devoted lots of time towards learning to use and developing with " +
    "Arduinos and Raspberry Pis.I especially love developing projects with the Arduino to bridge the gap " +
    "between hardware and software.";
